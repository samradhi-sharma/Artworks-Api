Every day is an opportunity to learn something new.

DAY 1 of learning something new.

🌟 What I Learned Today 🌟

Today, I delved into the fascinating world of APIs—short for Application Programming Interfaces. Think of APIs as the messengers that help different software applications talk to each other and share data, features, and functionality. Here’s a quick dive into what makes APIs so essential:

🤔 What is an API?

An API is a set of rules or protocols that enables software applications to communicate and interact with one another seamlessly. Imagine it as a bridge that connects various software components, allowing them to work together.

💡 Key Takeaways about APIs:

Solving Integration Issues: APIs tackle the problem of tightly-coupled systems in MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications by providing a flexible communication layer.

Frontend & Backend Harmony: By defining a clear interface, APIs allow the frontend and backend components to interact smoothly without being tightly linked.

Flexibility and Modularity: APIs make it easier to update or modify individual components without disrupting the entire system. This means you can innovate and improve your application more efficiently.

Reusability and Integration: APIs enable code reusability and allow you to leverage existing services and data from other applications. This promotes a more modular and interconnected system.

🔍 Why It Matters:
Understanding APIs is crucial for building robust and scalable applications. They not only simplify communication between different software components but also enhance the ability to adapt and grow your application over time.

Tight Coupling

Definition:

Tight coupling happens when different parts of a system are closely linked, meaning a change in one part can directly affect others.

Example:

Imagine a traditional website where the frontend and backend are tightly integrated. If you need to update the backend logic, you might have to make changes to the frontend as well.

Loose Coupling

Definition:

Loose coupling means components are linked through well-defined interfaces, so changes in one part have minimal impact on others.

Example:

Consider a microservices architecture where each service communicates via APIs. Updating one service doesn’t affect the others as long as the API contracts stay the same.

It is noticed that in each POST request for book id is being given to it which is unique.

Here it is noticed that for GET request without mentioning any query will provide all the details that has been posted so far.

Here on mentioning the id we get the specific output only.

I deleted id 4 item, nothing shown yet, let's get all the items then it will be clear whether that item is deleted or not .

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/307354a7-2f1e-4292-9663-0a8e6ff12da8)

Oh yes it got deleted.

That's how it works!
